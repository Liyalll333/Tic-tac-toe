Simple console game Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: 
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. 
A single mistake usually costs you the game, 
but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
I've programmed tic-tac-toe!

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe is a graduate project for track Python for Beginners. 
Graduate projects contain core topics for this track. 
I needed to apply the main topics at the stages of the project to test my knowledge.

After finishing this project, 
I learned a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch,
using functions, error handling, and handling user input.
